# tasmota32-eth
Prebuilt binaries of Tasmota32 (Tasmota on ESP32) with Ethernet support.

Tasmota offers some compiled binary in its repository with different features included. (see [Here](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/blob/development/BUILDS.md))
However, as of 28 Jan, 2020, all precompiled Tasmota32 binaries are built without Ethernet support i.e., wired connection is available in these builds.

I built some binaries for my personal use, download it if you want. Feel free to open issues to ask me to build the binaries with new version of source code.
