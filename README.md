This repository includes some prebuilt binaries of [Tasmota32](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/ESP32/) ([Tasmota](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota) on ESP32) variants with Ethernet support.

Tasmota official repository offers some compiled binary in its repository [with different features included]((https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/blob/development/BUILDS.md)), however, as of 28 Jan, 2020, precompiled Tasmota32 binaries are built without Ethernet support i.e., wired connection isn't available in these prebuilts.

So I built some binaries WITH `USE_ETHERNET` for my personal use, download it if you want. Feel free to open issues to ask me to build the binaries with new version of source code.
